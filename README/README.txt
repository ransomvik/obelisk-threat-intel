Overview:
---------
Obelisk Threat Intel is a Splunk App that automatically correlates your data
with several popular open threat lists. After a few mouse clicks we can start
hunting for log sources that are reaching out to, or being attacked from,
known attackers. The app can provide increased visibility to potentially
malicious activity going on in the organization.

Features:
--------
*Threat list visualization that shows where most of the attackers are located on a globe.
*Easily choose indexes, sourcetypes, or hosts for log entries that match
threat list destination IPs, domains, and URLs
*Email alerting feature.
*Easy setup screen.
*IP search feature that displays threat list activity.
*Domain search feature that displays threat list activity.
*Updated information is pulled down from the web every 8 hours.

Prerequisites:
--------------
*Splunk 6.x or 7.x
*Linux or Windows Operating System
*If there is a distributed environment, install the app on the ad hoc search head only.
*Web access is required to several threat lists.

Special note:
-------------
As of version 3.10, the app has split into two: obelisk_threat_intel (this app) and obelisk_TA_threat.
The obelisk_threat_intel app continues to be installed on search heads. the obelisk_TA_threat app
is to be installed on a single heavy forwarder in the environment only.
